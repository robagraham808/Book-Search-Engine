AS AN avid reader

I WANT to search for new books to read

SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
I have built a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API.

It has been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

This app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
